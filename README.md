# Wildlife Park

Wildlife Park is a simulated zoo organization app that allows you to view, create, and delete habitats and animals in the park.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The backend of this project was created using Rack. The link to the backend repository is here: https://github.com/hopebradley/phase-3-ruby-group-project-rack-react

## Opening The App

In the 'backend' folder of the backend repository, run bundle install. If you would like to start Wildlife Park with a few pre-existing animals and habitats, run rake db:seed in the backend folder before starting.

Then, start the server with
### `shotgun --port=9292`
so that the app has access to the active record database.

To open the app in the browser, run
### `yarn start`
and then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Use

On the home page of the app, there is a link to the animals page and the habitats page. Click either link or use the navigation bar at the top to view the animals and habitats. To delete an animal or habitat, click the 'delete' button on the one you would like to delete. To add a new animal, find the habitat you would like to add an animal to and fill out the form there with the right information. The animal will be added to the habitat when you click "Add". To add a habitat, fill out the form at the bottom of the habitat page. Your habitat will appear on the page, and you can add animals to it as you please.
